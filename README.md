# ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough
=========

ft_printf is a custom implementation of the `printf` function from the standard C
library. It formats and prints a string to the standard output stream using a
specified format string and variable number of arguments.

Building ft_printf
-----------------

To build ft_printf, run the following commands from the root of the project directory:
$ make

This will compile the source code for the ft_printf library and create a static
library file called `libftprintf.a.
